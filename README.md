# ReBBBorn-Kingdom-Rush-1-Mod
All hero changes will state level 10 stats or more info, but stat growth is assumed to be changed as well unless otherwise stated. Abilities will display all tiers. Updates marked by a + sign are intended buffs or neutral changes, while updates marked by a - sign are intended nerfs. If something is listed with 0 changes, it was left as is intentionally. Anything not yet listed is yet to be changed or not yet done in the changelog. KR1 hero heal rates maintain the 25% rule so their changes are unlisted.
